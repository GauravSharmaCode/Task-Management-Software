# üìã Requirement Analysis ‚Äì Advanced Task Management Application

## üß± Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js (React-based, optimized for SSR and routing)
- **Backend:** Django REST Framework (Python)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (via Docker image)
- **Real-Time Communication:** WebSockets (via Django Channels)
- **Caching:** Redis (for performance optimization & WebSocket pub/sub)
- **Containerization:** Docker & Docker Compose

---

## ‚úÖ Functional Requirements

### 1. **Task Management**

- Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) for tasks
- Attributes: Title, Description, Priority, Status (To Do/In Progress/Completed), Due Date, Assigned User

### 2. **User Authentication & Roles**

- Token-based authentication using DRF's `TokenAuthentication`
- User Roles:
  - **Admin:** Can manage all users and tasks
  - **Regular User:** Can manage only their own tasks
- Role-based permission system using Django‚Äôs permission framework or custom decorators

### 3. **Advanced Filtering**

- Filter by:
  - Due Date
  - Priority
  - Assigned User
  - Status
- Support combinations of filters for fine-grained control

### 4. **Real-Time Task Updates**

- WebSocket support via Django Channels
- Notify connected clients of task changes in real time
- Trigger updates when a task is created/updated/deleted

### 5. **Notifications**

- In-app notifications for real-time collaboration (e.g., ‚ÄúTask A updated by User X‚Äù)
- Display toast or badge alerts on the frontend
- (Bonus) Store notifications in DB for persistence

## ‚öôÔ∏è Non-Functional Requirements

### üîí Security

- Token-based secure API access
- Role-based route protection in both frontend and backend

### ‚ö° Performance

- Use Redis to:
  - Cache task lists with frequent filters
  - Manage WebSocket pub/sub channels
- Database indexing on fields like due_date, assigned_user for optimized query performance

### üîÑ Scalability

- Microservice-friendly design with modular Django apps (e.g., `users`, `tasks`, `notifications`)
- Stateless frontend using Next.js with API integration

### üê≥ DevOps

- Dockerize services (backend, frontend, Redis, PostgreSQL)
- Use `.env` files for managing secrets
- Use `docker-compose` for orchestration during development

### ‚úÖ Testing

- Backend: Django unit and integration tests for critical logic (authentication, task updates)
- Frontend: Component tests using Jest & React Testing Library
- End-to-end (E2E) testing (optional): Playwright or Cypress
